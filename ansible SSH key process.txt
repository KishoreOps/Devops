Put this in your `users.yml` file, add as many users as you need:

- name: Create user
   remote_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Create new user
      user:
        name: kishore
		state: present
    - name: Create .ssh folder
      file:
        path: ~/.ssh
        cccc: directory
        owner: kishore
        group: kishore
        mode: 0700
     - name: Upload SSH key
       copy:
        src: ../keys/kishore
        dest: ~kishore/.ssh/id_rsa
        owner: kishore
        group: kishore
        mode: 0700


In your playbook root folder, create a folder `keyfiles`.  In it, create a subfolder for 
each username for which you want to copy keyfiles to the server.  Put the private and public key files,
as well as any other files, such as `known_hosts` in the user subfolder.

Now run your playbook.

ansible-playbook playbooks/users.yml --limit "host1","host2","host3"

It will copy the user key in remote machines by pull mechanism.
